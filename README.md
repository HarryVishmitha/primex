## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## API & Sanctum Authentication

This project includes Laravel Sanctum for SPA cookie authentication and personal access tokens.

### Environment

Ensure the following environment variables are set (already present in `.env.example`):

- SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS: Comma-separated list of frontend origins that should receive stateful cookies.
- SESSION_SAME_SITE: For same-site SPA on the same domain, keep `lax`. If your SPA is on a different domain and you use HTTPS, set `none` and `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`.

### Routes

- Public: `GET /api/ping` → `{ ok: true }`
- Authenticated: `GET /api/user` (requires `auth:sanctum`)

### SPA (Cookie) flow

1. GET `/sanctum/csrf-cookie` to receive the CSRF token cookie.
2. POST `/login` with credentials and the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header.
3. Subsequent `GET /api/user` returns the authenticated user.

### Token flow

Issue a token on the server:

```php
// Example: in a controller after validating credentials
$token = $user->createToken('api')->plainTextToken;
```

Use it from a client:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Notes

- API routes are enabled via `routes/api.php` and registered in `bootstrap/app.php`.
- Protect any endpoint by adding the `auth:sanctum` middleware.
